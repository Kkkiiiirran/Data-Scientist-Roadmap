## Approach

* 1. start by sorting the array
* 2. taking two pointers both strating from 0
* 3. maintaining the cummulative sum till i-j
* 4. incrementing i whenver target * windowsize - cummulative sum becomes more than the k number of operations allowed
* 5. repeat 4 till i becomes less than k
* 6. keep maintaining ans as max of window size
